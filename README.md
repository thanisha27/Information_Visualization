**Airfare Price Prediction Using Supervised and Ensemble ML Models**

In the travel industry, estimating flight costs is an essential job that impacts both service providers and clients. This study looks at how well supervised machine learning models work along with ensemble learning methodologies to accurately forecast travel costs. The study uses historical flight data with a range of parameters, such as airline, flight, source city, arrival time, destination city, class, length, days remaining, and price. Feature engineering techniques are used to extract data, and measures such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, R2 score, Root Means squared Log error, Mean Absolute percentage error and Adj R Square are used to properly assess the model's performance. The experimental results demonstrate the relative performance of each model and ensemble technique and also point out the benefits and drawbacks of the models in terms of flight price prediction. The study visually compares each modelâ€™s metrics and predicts the better model. The study's conclusions can assist consumers in creating reasonable travel plans and the travel industry's stakeholders in making educated decisions on pricing tactics.
